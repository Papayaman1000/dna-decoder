# dna-decoder
A simple tool to convert between DNA, RNA, amino acids, and English (via a special key).

## Wait, huh?
It's nothing special. Just something I cobbled together in about two hours.
I might improve it some, but for the most part I'm fine with it as-is. See an improvement
you can make? Add it if you feel like it, whatevs. Feel free to use it for whatever, too,
just so long as you don't try to sell it as-is and kick me some credit. I can't actually
enforce this, and probably wouldn't do anything beyond shoot a few angry emails if I could,
but it's still appreciated, yeah?
